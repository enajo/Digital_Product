## 🧠 What is QuickDoc?

**QuickDoc** is a simple web app that helps patients find **last-minute doctor appointments** when someone else cancels or doesn’t show up.

It connects patients with nearby clinics that have unexpected openings — helping patients get faster care and clinics avoid lost time.

## ❗ The Problem

In Germany and many other countries, patients often wait **weeks** to see a doctor, especially specialists or therapists. Meanwhile, clinics lose valuable time and income every day due to **last-minute cancellations and no-shows**.

Language barriers also make healthcare difficult for many international patients, who often can’t find doctors that speak their language.

## 💡 Our Solution

QuickDoc allows:

- **Patients** to discover open slots nearby (filtered by time, specialty, and language)
- **Clinics** to instantly reopen canceled or missed slots  
- Real-time **notifications** sent to nearby flexible patients
- Language preference matching to avoid miscommunication

---

## 🔁 Example Scenario

> A 2:00 PM appointment gets canceled at 1:15 PM.  
> QuickDoc alerts nearby patients. One books it within minutes.  
> The clinic doesn’t lose the hour. The patient doesn’t have to wait weeks.
