## 🧠 What is QuickDoc?

**QuickDoc** is a simple web app that helps patients find **last-minute doctor appointments** when someone else cancels or doesn’t show up.

It connects patients with nearby clinics that have unexpected openings — helping patients get faster care and clinics avoid lost time.

## ❗ The Problem

In Germany and many other countries, patients often wait **weeks** to see a doctor, especially specialists or therapists. Meanwhile, clinics lose valuable time and income every day due to **last-minute cancellations and no-shows**.

Language barriers also make healthcare difficult for many international patients, who often can’t find doctors that speak their language.
